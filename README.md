# bedd: the bar editor

bedd is an open source, multifunctional editor and environment, with purposes ranging from file exploring to coding and note taking. Its
name comes from 'bar editor', due to the tab bar present on the top of the terminal, while also being a word play on the word "bed". It
uses keybindings and shortcuts commonly found in graphical text editors, in order to provide the flattest learning curve as possible. The
terminal UI is also optimized for simple terminals with limited color support, while being able to provide a "modern" interface. It also
provides builtin help in the form of a welcome screen with all the shortcuts present in bedd.
